I created this project and model for a deepfaketection Competion ,whitch can get a 98% accuracy

# Training

# Dataset
I crawaled alomst all of the images on civitai.com and chose some of them for fake images. I use coco dataset and OpenFace-CQUPT/HumanCaption-10M on huggingface(I can't promise all of the image is not generated by ai) for real dataset.
